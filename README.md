# Loan Amount Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the amount of loan a customer is likely to be sanctioned based on historical loan approval data using machine learning techniques. It uses a linear regression model and evaluates performance using K-Fold cross-validation.

## Project Overview

- **Problem Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Task:** Regression
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **Evaluation Method:** 5-Fold Cross-Validation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Features of the Project

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling using Standardization
- Model training with Linear Regression
- Performance evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score
- K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation
- Visualization of:
  - Predicted vs Actual values
  - Residual distribution
  - Feature correlation heatmap
